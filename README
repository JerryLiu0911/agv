# Delivery Robot Project

This project implements a prototype delivery robot designed to collect and deliver packages to residences. The robot is part of a larger automated guided vehicle (AGV) system for package pickup and delivery.

## Project Overview

The delivery robot is designed to:
- Navigate to package pickup points
- Collect packages (up to 4 at a time)
- Deliver packages to designated residential areas
- Operate autonomously for 5 minutes before returning to the charging station

## Software Implementation

As the software developer for this project, my role focuses on:
- Implementing the control algorithm
- Developing the high-level strategy for efficient package delivery
- Programming the robot using Arduino

### Development Environment

This project uses PlatformIO as the development environment. PlatformIO is an open-source ecosystem for IoT development that simplifies the process of building Arduino projects.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation
- Package collection and delivery
- LED indicators for robot status
- Timed operation (5-minute runs)
